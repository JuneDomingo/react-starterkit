# React Starterkit
> Build web apps using ReactJS, Redux, Webpack and Babel

### Tech
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - A bundler for javascript and friends
- [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - A complete routing library for React
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Compiles ES6 to ES5. Enjoy the new version of JavaScript today
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX
- NPM scripts - Run project with just one command

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4
- [Bower](https://bower.io/)
- [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share code with other developers from around the world. Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you donâ€™t ever have to worry.

### Installation

Install Yarn
```sh
$ npm install yarn -g
```

Clone this repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JuneDomingo/react-starterkit.git
$ cd react-starterkit
$ yarn install
$ npm start -s
```

Clone the API repo (Optional)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JuneDomingo/react-starterkit-api.git
$ cd react-starterkit-api
$ yarn install
$ npm start
```

### Useful Commands
- `npm start` - Start the app (it will automatically open http://localhost:3005 on your default browser). Add `-s` option to start the app in silent mode.
- `npm run lint` - Analyze the entire app and it will report possible syntax errors and warnings based on ESlint rules.
- `npm run lint:watch` - Same as `npm run lint` but this will run continuously and analyze the file as you save it.
- `npm run build` - Build the app for production. Output files are located in `./dist` folder.
- `npm run prod` - Start the app in production mode.

### Configurations
You might want to edit `.env` located in your app root directory.

General Settings
- `PORT` - Default is `3005`

Dev Settings
- `OPEN_BROWSER_ON_START` - Set to `FALSE` if you don't want your app to automatically open the default browser upon running `npm start`. Default is `TRUE`

### Extras
- [reactgen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactgen) - React Component Generator
