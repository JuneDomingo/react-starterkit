# React Starterkit
> Build web apps using ReactJS, Redux, Webpack and Babel

### Tech
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - A bundler for javascript and friends
* [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - A complete routing library for React
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Compiles ES6 to ES5. Enjoy the new version of JavaScript today
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - Lint JS. Reports syntax and style issues
* NPM scripts - Run project with just one command

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.
* [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Yarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and share code with other developers from around the world. Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you donâ€™t ever have to worry.
